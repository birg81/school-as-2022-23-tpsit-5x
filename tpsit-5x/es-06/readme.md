In the advanced version of the exercise, the execution time diagram is also drawn.
To draw the graph you need to use the Matplotlib library
To use this library you must first install it
write the command on your console:

```batch
pip install matplotlib
```
or
```batch
python -m pip install matplotlib
```

Maybe you will be asked to update pip, so write on the console:
```batch
pip install ––upgrade pip
```
or
```batch
python -m pip install ––upgrade pip
```

If you have problems, you can replace python with:
your complete python path
```batch
C:\Program Files\Python\Python310\python.exe
```
or your local path
```batch
C:\Users\<YOUR USER>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe
```
if you have a Local installation
